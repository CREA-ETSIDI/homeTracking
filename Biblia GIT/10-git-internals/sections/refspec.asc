[[_refspec]]
=== The Refspec

Throughout this book, we've used simple mappings from remote branches to local references, but they can be more complex.
Suppose you add a remote like this:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
----

It adds a section to your `.git/config` file, specifying the name of the remote (`origin`), the URL of the remote repository, and the refspec for fetching:

[source,ini]
----
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
----

The format of the refspec is an optional `+`, followed by `<src>:<dst>`, where `<src>` is the pattern for references on the remote side and `<dst>` is where those references will be written locally.
The `+` tells Git to update the reference even if it isn't a fast-forward.

In the default case that is automatically written by a `git remote add` command, Git fetches all the references under `refs/heads/` on the server and writes them to `refs/remotes/origin/` locally.
So, if there is a `master` branch on the server, you can access the log of that branch locally via

[source,console]
----
$ git log origin/master
$ git log remotes/origin/master
$ git log refs/remotes/origin/master
----

They're all equivalent, because Git expands each of them to `refs/remotes/origin/master`.

If you want Git instead to pull down only the `master` branch each time, and not every other branch on the remote server, you can change the fetch line to

[source]
----
fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
----

This is just the default refspec for `git fetch` for that remote.
If you want to do something one time, you can specify the refspec on the command line, too.
To pull the `master` branch on the remote down to `origin/mymaster` locally, you can run

[source,console]
----
$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster
----

You can also specify multiple refspecs.
On the command line, you can pull down several branches like so:

[source,console]
----
$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster \
	 topic:refs/remotes/origin/topic
From git@github.com:schacon/simplegit
 ! [rejected]        master     -> origin/mymaster  (non fast forward)
 * [new branch]      topic      -> origin/topic
----

In this case, the `master` branch pull was rejected because it wasn't a fast-forward reference.
You can override that by specifying the `+` in front of the refspec.

You can also specify multiple refspecs for fetching in your configuration file.
If you want to always fetch the `master` and `experiment` branches, add two lines:

[source,ini]
----
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
	fetch = +refs/heads/experiment:refs/remotes/origin/experiment
----

You can't use partial globs in the pattern, so this would be invalid:

[source,ini]
----
fetch = +refs/heads/qa*:refs/remotes/origin/qa*
----

However, you can use namespaces (or directories) to accomplish something like that.
If you have a QA team that pushes a series of branches, and you want to get the `master` branch and any of the QA team's branches but nothing else, you can use a config section like this:

[source,ini]
----
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
	fetch = +refs/heads/qa/*:refs/remotes/origin/qa/*
----

If you have a complex workflow process that has a QA team pushing branches, developers pushing branches, and integration teams pushing and collaborating on remote branches, you can namespace them easily this way.

[[_pushing_refspecs]]
==== Pushing Refspecs

It's nice that you can fetch namespaced references that way, but how does the QA team get their branches into a `qa/` namespace in the first place?
You accomplish that by using refspecs to push.

If the QA team wants to push their `master` branch to `qa/master` on the remote server, they can run

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin master:refs/heads/qa/master
----

If they want Git to do that automatically each time they run `git push origin`, they can add a `push` value to their config file:

[source,ini]
----
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa/master
----

Again, this will cause a `git push origin` to push the local `master` branch to the remote `qa/master` branch by default.

==== Deleting References

You can also use the refspec to delete references from the remote server by running something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin :topic
----

Because the refspec is `<src>:<dst>`, by leaving off the `<src>` part, this basically says to make the `topic` branch on the remote nothing, which deletes it.
